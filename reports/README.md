# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

``--- question 1 fill here ---``

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

### Question 3

> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

Our project is built within the PyTorch framework, and it has significantly facilitated the entire project lifecycle. Data preparation, model, training and predictions are built on top of the Pytorch library. The PyTorch ecosystem provided us a robust foundation, enabling us to efficiently implement our models. The models themselves are sourced from the PyTorch Image Models package, available at [PyTorch Image Models](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models). This choice of framework not only streamlined the implementation process but also offered us extensive community support and a variaty of pre-built models. The flexibility and scalability of PyTorch have proven instrumental in meeting the project's objectives, showcasing the framework's effectiveness in tackling machine learning operations challenges.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

In our project, we managed our dependencies through a `requirements.txt` file. This is a simple text file that contains a list of all the packages that we use and was auto-generated using the package pipreqs which automatically scanned our project and created a requirements file specific to it. To ensure consistency across team members, the following steps are recommended for a new member to replicate the environment. Firstly, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory and verify that the `requirements.txt` file exists. Optionally, create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. Activate the environment and install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This process guarantees that the new team member's environment mirrors the project's dependencies accurately.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

From the cookiecutter template we have filled out all the folders except the docs folder, the notebooks folder and the visualizations folder inside the {{cookiecutter.project_name}} folder which in our case is called "src". Furthermore there is a folder called "mlops_group17.egg-info" which is generated from the command $(PYTHON_INTERPRETER) -m pip install -e . in our Makefile. We also have another additional folder called "outputs" which is generated through hydra. Inside the src folder we have the models, the config files and the make_dataset.py which imports our dataset inside the "data" folder. Lastly, inside the tests folder we have the unit tests related to the data part of our code and to model training.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

In our project, we implemented code quality and formatting rules using Ruff. These rules are crucial in larger projects for several reasons. Firstly, consistent code formatting enhances readability, making it easier for team members to understand and collaborate on the codebase. It ensures a uniform structure, reducing confusion and potential errors caused by inconsistent styling. Code quality rules, on the other hand, help identify potential issues early in the development process, ensuring that the code meets certain standards and is less likely to have errors.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

In total, we have implemented seven tests across the files inside the "tests" folder. In the test_data.py file, we have two tests: the test_images_to_tensor which checks if the length of the tensor list matches the number of image files and also checks if the shape of the first tensor in the list is correct and furthermore the test_retrieve_from_api which calls the `retrieve_from_api` function with mock objects. The test_training.py file includes multiple test cases for the training module including test_custom_dataset, test_load_data, test_setup_model_and_optimizer, test_train_one_epoch and test_train.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

The total code coverage of our project stands at 65%, including all our source code. While this percentage indicates a substantial coverage, the remaining 35% highlights potential untested paths that demand thorough exploration. Achieving 100% code coverage is valuable, but it doesn't assure absolute error-free code. Complete coverage ensures that every line is executed under specific conditions, yet it may not cover all scenarios, edge cases, or intricate interactions between components. Furthermore, maintaining a balance between coverage and thoughtful testing strategies is essential for robust code quality.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, our workflow involved branches and pull requests. Apart from the main branch and the develop branch, we utilized five additional branches to manage different aspects of our development process. We made additional branches including unit_test (to include the unit tests), another for creating the Fast API, one for monitoring and data drifting and one for setting up the cloud. To merge code in Git, we typically use the "git merge" command. The common workflow involved navigating to the branch where the changes should have been merged (e.g., the main branch or develop branch) and then using the "git merge" command followed by the name of the branch containing the changes. Additionally, if the changes are developed in a separate feature branch, pull requests were used. Pull requests allowed for code review and discussion before the changes were merged into the target branch, ensuring a more controlled and collaborative approach to incorporating new code.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we employed DVC (Data Version Control) to manage data in our project, and it significantly enhanced our workflow by providing version control for datasets. DVC allowed us to track, share, and manage large files efficiently. This versioning capability was crucial for reproducibility, as we could precisely reproduce any experiment by referencing the specific dataset version. DVC's integration with Git also helped us a lot. By keeping track of changes in both code and data, we could create a comprehensive record of our project's evolution. DVC's support for remote storage further ensured that datasets were not only versioned locally but could also be shared and accessed by team members, resulting to a more organized and collaborative data management process in our project.

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test**
> **multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of**
> **your github actions workflow.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our CI into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing and one for running*
> *... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: `<weblink>`*
>
> Answer:

#138 words

Our continuous integration (CI) setup is structured into workflows to ensure comprehensive testing and maintain code quality. The first workflow focuses on unit testing, utilizing the `unittest` framework. We ensure compatibility with Python 3.10.13, a version specified in the workflow. By defining specific versions, we aim to maintain consistency across different environments and prevent potential compatibility issues. To validate the integration of third-party services, such as Kaggle, we have a setup step for configuring Kaggle API credentials securely. This allows our tests to interact with external services while maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information. For a detailed example of our CI workflow, you can refer to this [here](https://github.com/diogo4256/mlops_group_17/blob/develop/.github/workflows/tests.yml). This file illustrates the steps taken in our CI process, including setting up Python, installing dependencies, and executing tests.
